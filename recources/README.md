>  
>  [optional body]
>  
>  [optional footer(s)]
> ```

+ **init:** 
  - initialize new project or repository
  - set up project structure
  - add necessary files
  - perform essential configurations
+ **build:** 
  - make changes related to build systems or dependencies
  - make modifications to build scripts, configurations, or tools
+ **docs:**
  - make changes to documentation files or user guides
  - update or improve README files
+ style:
  - change code style or formatting
  - make whitespace or indentation adjustments
  - update code comment  
+ refactor:
  - restructure or reorganize existing codebase
  - improve code readability
  - optimize performance without changing overall behavior  
+ **fix:** 
  - patche bug in codebase (like **PATCH**);
  - address bug or issue in codebase
  - resolve problem
  - fix incorrect behavior or software defect
+ **feat:** 
  - introduce new feature to codebase (like **MINOR**);
  - add significant enhancements, improvements, or entirely new capabilities
  - implement new module
  - introduct new API endpoint
  - incorporate new user-facing feature
+ perf:
  - make changes aimed at improving performance of project
  - optimizate algorithm
  - enhance execution speed or resource usage
+ test:
  - add, modify, or update tests
  - change unit or integration tests
+ ci:
  - configure continuous integration (CI) 
  - modificate CI pipeline, build scripts 
  - made adjustments to integration or deployment processes  
+ chore:
  - for miscellaneous or trivial changes that don't fit into any other category
  - update package manager files,
  - refactore code for code style consistency
  - make general project maintenance changes  
+ type/scope **!:** 
  - introduce breaking API change (like **MAJOR**);
