### ``[optional scope]``
> you should choose relevant value that reflects area of project being modified
- core
  * _include essential features and services used by framework_
- forms
  * _handle form validation, data binding, and form controls_
- http
  * _provides services for making HTTP requests and handling responses_
- animations
  * _adding, modifying, or fixing animation-related features or effects_
- common
  * _changes in common/shared components or functionality used throughout app_
- router
  * _provide routing and navigation functionality for application_
- service-worker
- upgrade

### ``<description>``
> * _the subject contains a succinct description of the change_
> * _use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"_
> * _don't capitalize the first letter_
> * _no dot (.) at the end_
  
###  ``[optional body]``
> * _use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"._
> * _it should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior._
  
### ``[optional footer(s)]``  
> * _it should contain any information about Breaking Changes_
> * _it is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes_
> * _BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this._
