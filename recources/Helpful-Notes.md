# Helpful Notes
&emsp;**VCS** (version control systems) — helps to track the history of source code changes and to work comfortably in a team.\
**A repository** is a common name for a source code repository. The code in the repository is stored as commit histories—small changes to the source code.
Conventional file stores cannot show parallel change histories of the same file, but VCS can.\
&emsp;The **Git CLI** is a console interface to Git that runs in a terminal.

## Git
&emsp;**Bash** is an abbreviation for Bourne Again Shell, which we enable in the required project folder.
